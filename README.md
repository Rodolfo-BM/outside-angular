## Outside

In a conversation between friends, we discussed how some parts of the city are no longer used or are not eve known by the community due to lack of information. We often pass by a place without even imagining that a few meters away there is an entrance to a park. We often choose a shorter route to reach a destination, but we miss several interesting points along the way that could enrich the tour. So we thought about how interesting it would be to find a way to unite the interest in nature with the need to move urban centers, to relive forgotten points in the city and to use the most knowledgeable to feed the content: the residents themselves.
